House Rooms Notes
/*
		House Rooms...
			,,,expanding the horizons of your living space.

		~~ History ~~
		
		1.0.0
			Initial Release
			
		1.0.1
			Added ("housemorerooms") hook, for those that
			may wish to hook in their own rooms.
			
		1.0.2
			Switched some stuff from preferences to
			settings and made everything better.

		1.0.3
			Introduced a -true- checks system to
			ensure that the module won't steal rooms
			away from other modules when they're in
			service.
			
		1.0.4
			Standardizing the Go Back changes over
			all versions.
			
		1.0.5
			Laid out a floorplan, navs connecting
			Bathroom and Bedroom now exist and navs
			connecting Kitchen and Longe now exist
			too.  Furthermore, one can exit from any
			ground floor room to the village, yet
			they cannot exit off the top floor.
			
			This would be unwise and would result
			in a heroic, yet piontless; "I regret
			nothing!" moment, as our poor player
			would plummet ... well, actually they
			wouldn't but they'd expect to.
			
			So it's better this way.
			
		1.0.6
			Did a tiny bit of a rewrite of the navs
			hook thanks to an issue spotted by
			Ailean, it looks better all around now
			I think.  It actually looks quite nice
			and it's leaning more towards what I'm
			hoping for.
			
		1.0.7
			$REQUEST_URI is my friend, I proclaim my
			undying love for $REQUEST_URI and its
			awesomeness shall deserve a nice little
			placque in my room, much like modulehook.
			
			Another bug squished, seems I couldn't
			use httpget ("op") in a case, like, at
			all, period.  This was responsible for
			many of the problems that ... oh, almost
			everyone might've been seeing.
			
			Hurrah!  I am happy.
			
		1.0.8
			REQUEST_URI to the rescue, as it just
			stopped the house navs from showing up
			in the Residential Zone, which really
			should not happen.
			
		1.0.9
			Added an 'Exits From Here' header.
			
		2.0.0
			This is largely the version number of
			the new check system I have in place
			to make sure that no matter how many
			plugins a room has, none of them can
			screw up the player so that they can't
			enter their room or use their stuff.
			In fact, I'm absolutely positive that
			this is highly improbable, possibly
			even impossible at that.  This means
			that one of the hardest tasks I'd set
			out to do has now been finished.
			
			If you were having any problems with
			House Rooms or the rooms plugins,
			these should all now be fixed.
			Absolutely and without doubt, I even
			put in little checks on install and
			uninstall to let you know if it's
			not working as I so adamantly claim
			it will and to perkily proclaim so
			if it is.
			
			That aisde ...
			
			I've also switched every if I could
			find over to cases, just to see if
			I could figure it out ... it seems
			to be going well and I'll say this
			much -- it does look a lot cleaner.
			I thank Sichae for the switch/case
			related pestering on the forums, I
			was wrong.
			
			Heck, look at how I handle my script
			info, this switch stuff should have
			been more appealing, it does look
			pretty.  I guess I was just scared
			of a system that I knew nothing of
			(at the time).  I'm big enough to
			admit that.
			
			That aside ...
			
			I found and cleared out some useless
			code, just streamlining the script,
			really.
			
		2.0.1 & 2.0.2
			This was the development cycle to
			properly impliment the new modulehook
			in 'Where can I go from here?'.  Well,
			that's the official excuse anyway, in
			reality I just wanted to keep things
			proper-looking.
			
			Basically, there's a new nav:
			
			houseroomswherecan
			
			If you add a room to House Rooms and
			you want to be able to report that it
			can be exited to under particular
			conditions, then you can hook into
			this with that condition, as I have
			done in the new housebedroomvault and
			houseloungekeys plugins.
			
		2.0.3
			By including disablemh=1 in the
			runmodule section of your URI before
			any ops, you can stop the Main Hall
			navs and descs from showing at all.
			
			This has been used by Bedroom Vault
			and Lounge successfully.  I find
			this discovery intriguing!  I shall
			investigate switching some of the
			clumsier blocknavs over to it, if
			I haven't dealt with those already
			... don't remember.  *Sheepish.*
			
		2.0.4
			Lonny dropped the idea that it might
			be fun to introduce a system wherein
			houses become available at a certain
			house construction rank.  I've just
			now implimented that system, it can
			be configured under Settings.
			
		2.0.5
			I cleaned up the Build Status page a
			little, this now checks to make sure
			the navs themselves are active, else
			we'd have players complaining that
			they saved so long to obtain a room
			only to have it mysteriously not
			appear in their home.  That would
			suck for them and as I wish no undue
			hardship towards any players, the
			check is now in place.
			
		2.0.6
			I missed a $housesize variable in
			one of the cases which resulted in
			interroom travel on the correct
			floors being inaccessible.
			
		2.0.7
			Minor code cleanup.
			
		2.0.8
			Added a Garden.
 
		~~ Installation ~~
		
		You can either use the House script inside
		this zip (which as I'm aware is the latest
		version, I snagged it at 20:40 on 22/12/04
		and I shall try to keep up, please let me
		know if there is a newer version) or you
		can make the edits I've listed here.
		
		Open ... :
			./modules/house.php
		
		Find ... :
			addnav ("Return");
			addnav ("Back to the Residential Quarter", "runmodule.php?module=house");
			villagenav();
			page_footer();
			
		Insert before ... :
			modulehook ("houseroomshook");

		So it looks like ... :
			modulehook ("houseroomshook");
			addnav ("Return");
			addnav ("Back to the Residential Quarter", "runmodule.php?module=house");
			villagenav();
			page_footer();

		Save and close the file.

		~~ Usage ~~
		
		Simply hook into the contents hooks for each
		room as they're shown below ...
		
			loungecontents
			bedroomcontents
			bathroomcontents
			kitchencontents
			cellarcontents
		
		... and use a case to add things to each of
		them as you please.  Take a look at the
		Bathroom here:
		
		http://mastaile.mine.nu/Bathroom-098.zip
		
		That explains how you can set rooms as not
		empty and enabled ready to be hooked into.
		
		Finally, here are the hooks if you wish to
		add more rooms to the House.
		
			houseroomsaddnavs
				This is for the nav listing that
				shows up in the Main Hall area of
				the House.  This is where the
				standard navs of House Rooms are
				first seen.
				
			houseroomsnavdescs
				This is for the output that tells
				the player what rooms they can
				go back to, if they're in Kitchen
				for example this would tell them
				that Lounge is a room they can
				exit to, along with Main Hall.
				
			houseroomsinroomsaddnavs
				This is the check to see if a
				player is in a room and then to
				only offer relevant navs out of
				that room.  For example, if the
				player were in the Lounge, the
				navs here would only allow exit
				to Kitchen and Main Hall, it's
				the functional equivalent of
				houseroomnavdesc's window
				dressing.
			
			roomsdefines
				This is for the modules to let
				this script know that they're
				installed and active. Basically
				as you can see in other scripts
				it just sets the 'full' and
				'navs' prefs relevantly.  Refer
				to one of the existing plugin
				scripts to see how it works,
				if you're curious.

Lounge Keys Notes

		Lounge Ksys...
			,,,moving things around to give this multi-
				floored house a little depth.

		~~ History ~~
		
		1.0.0
			Initial Release

		2.0.0
			This is largely the version number of
			the new check system I have in place
			to make sure that no matter how many
			plugins a room has, none of them can
			screw up the player so that they can't

			uninstall to let you know if it's
			not working as I so adamantly claim
			it will and to perkily proclaim so
			if it is.
			
		2.0.1 & 2.0.2
			This is the development cycle for
			the navs handling and implimentating
			of 'Where can I go from here?'
			within this script.
			
			Basically, if you Cut or Withdrew
			a Key in the old script you could go
			just about anywhere in the house,
			that was bad.  So in this version,
			only the relevant navs are provided.
			Stare at the code in horror (!) as I
			gleefully abuse named ops to ensure
			it doesn't break.

		2.0.3
			This version now includes the
			new disablemh=1 to deal with the
			errant Main Hall.  This way,
			there are currently /no/ navs
			running erroneously.  The only
			nav back from Cut and Withdraw
			is Lounge.  Hurrah!

		2.0.4
			Makeshift solution to the
			badnav problems with the vault
			navs.  I'll write up something
			better soon.
			
			Also, the Build Status nav was
			showing up when it shouldn't
			have.  This has been fixed.
			
		2.0.5
			I set out to migrate the keys
			system from house.php to here,
			to solve numerous issues with
			the integration.  This has
			been a resounding success as
			the system migrated perfectly
			and with great ease.
			
			Tested.  Confirmed.  *Stamp!*
			
			Thanks to Ailean for spotting
			this one in the first place.
			
			That aside ...
			
			Please note, aside from a few
			changes, the Keys system you
			see below is /completely/
			migrated from house.php, a
			script which this one still
			requires to function, you
			must have it installed but
			it should be credited anyway
			just because it's awesome.
			
		2.0.6
			A few changes to the system
			to bring it up to speed with
			the niftyness I introduced
			in the Bedroom Vault module.
			
		2.0.7
			Added Arune's additions to
			the keys sections of the
			house module, here.  Thanks
			be to him.

Kitchen Notes
/*
		House Kitchen...
			,,,we all get the munchies now and again,
				it's nice to have our own place to snack.

		~~ History ~~
		
		1.0.0
			Initial Release

		1.0.1
			Switched some stuff from preferences to
			settings and made everything better.
			
		1.0.2 / 1.0.3
			Introduced a -true- [sic] checks system
			to ensure that the module won't steal
			rooms away from other modules when
			they're in service.  Also, version
			bumped to 1.0.3 to match the other
			modules.
			
			(Hindsight: That guy right here?  He
			doesn't have a damned clue what he's
			talking about.)
			
		1.0.4
			A few typos fixed in regards to turns not
			being removed and the eatcookie subop
			lacking a dollarsign but they were rather
			nasty typos nonetheless which halted some
			parts of the script.  Many thanks to
			Ailean, whose Eagle-eyes and aid sent
			these buggers packing!
			
		1.0.5
			Standardizing the Go Back changes across
			all versions.
			
			This is largely because of a nasty bug
			spotted by Ailean with the cookies and
			because of minor issues that I knew
			existed in the Cellar module and mostly
			because I just wanted a cleaner, more
			modular system.
			
		1.0.6
			Added an !is_module_active check to make
			sure that the modules didn't +1 on
			/reinstall/ as they have been doing.  I
			suspect your modules will be over 1 now
			in your Settings.  Please go into House
			Rooms Settings and set all your 'number
			of modules using' to 0 or 1 respectively.
			
			Sorry about that.

		2.0.0
			This is largely the version number of
			the new check system I have in place
			to make sure that no matter how many
			plugins a room has, none of them can
			screw up the player so that they can't
			enter their room or use their stuff.

			I thank Sichae for the switch/case
			related pestering on the forums, I
			was wrong.
			
			Heck, look at how I handle my script
			info, this switch stuff should have
			been more appealing, it does look
			pretty.  I guess I was just scared
			of a system that I knew nothing of
			(at the time).  I'm big enough to
			admit that.
			
			That aside ...
			
			I've added two modulehooks to this
			script for those that might wish to
			add their own foods.  For those
			that might be feeling creative and
			all, I wouldn't deny them.
			
			The navs are as follows:
			
			housekitchennavs
				This is basically for the addnav
				that leads to your food.  So
				this case is just an addnav and
				nothing more.
				
			housekitchenfoods
				This nav is for the output and
				the effects of your food, this
				is where the addnav the above
				case provided will send your
				players, you have to provide
				the case for it up until break.

Bathroom Notes
/*
		House Bathroom...
			,,,when ya gotta go, ya gotta go!

		~~ History ~~
		
		1.0.0
			Initial Release
			
		1.0.1
			Removed the turns required for using
			the facilities as compared to the 5
			gold cost for the public facilities,
			they were unbalancing.  Thanks to
			Indi for that one!
			
		1.0.2
			Switched some stuff from preferences to

		1.0.4
			Gave Lonny more credit in the actual
			newspaper itself, I feel he deserves it.
			
		1.0.5
			Standardizing the Go Back changes across

			I've also fixed more bugs pointed

			it was the missing brand name of the
			toilet, correct me if I've missed
			anything, okay?

		~~ Credits ~~
		
		Lonny Loberts
			Once again, I've borrowed from one of my
			favourite coders.  I used his village news
			to provide the 'newspaper' we see on the
			toilet, for the entirety of that function,
			we can thank him.
			
			His Village News module can be found here:
			http://dragonprime.net/users/lonnyl/
			I highly recommend it and just about every
			other module he has there, in fact, his
			Odour and Bladder modules are required in
			this very module.

Cellar Notes

		~~ History ~~
		
		1.0.0
			Initial Release.
			
		
		1.0.2 / 1.0.3
			Internal changes, I forget what exactly
			but I was bumping the version number
			without keeping track, I believe it was
			related to a problem with using a
			function for travelling, this was in
			1.0.2 before the first public release,
			which was 1.0.3.

		1.0.4
			Standardizing the Go Back changes across
			all versions.
			
			This is largely because of a nasty bug
			spotted by Ailean with the cookies and
			because of minor issues that I knew
			existed in the Cellar module and mostly
			because I just wanted a cleaner, more
			modular system.

			Rooms Settings and set all your 'number
			of modules using' to 0 or 1 respectively.
			
			Sorry about that.
			
		1.0.6
			%s-ish issue thanks to a missed variable
			is fixed, thanks Ailean.

		1.0.7
			These changes were made by Enderandrew,
			and not the original author.  There was
			a bug where a function was being called
			that didn't exist.  I also optimized the
			code.
			
		~~ Credits and Information ~~
		
		If installed, this module works with Lonny
		Luberts' Hunger module (usechow.php), it uses
		the random food-finding code from the module
		itself.  This module doesn't actually -need-
		usechow.php to be installed but I do strongly
		endorese and recommend it, it's a far better
		experience with it installed, especially LoGD
		as a whole. It's an awesome module.
		
		You can find it here:
		
		http://dragonprime.net/users/lonnyl/
		
		- Further Credits -
		
		Sichae pointed me at a really good example as
		to how I might fetch a random name from the
		SQL database, the original code was from
		Lonny's Castle, to give full credits where
		they're due all around.
		
		Also, Kendaer helped out too (yay!) with LIMIT
		1, which I'd gather will really stop my CPU
		from frying with too many SQL requests.
		
		Thanks guys, you rock.

			I tossed in the administrator option to have
			the Sleep (Log Out) blocked from the Main
			Hall (as it's not very realistic) and have
			it only show up in the bedroom instead.
			This feature is thanks to the suggestion

			The vault navs were totally kaploofy, thanks
